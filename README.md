# Gaussian-Process-for-Epoxy
Gaussian Process in Python for 3501-6 Epoxy Material Model

Same method is presented in following paer for non-parametric models is used here:

 [1] Uncertinty Qualification of Material Models for Process Simulation, Fernlund et al., 2020, International SAMPE Technical Conference

Three temperature cycle can be considered: 
  
1. isothermal (to be updated)
2. constant rate 
3. one hold cycle (to be updated)

Independent variabes are: 

1. degree of cure
2. temperature

Dependent variable is:
1. rate of degree of cure
